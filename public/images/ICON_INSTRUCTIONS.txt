CREATE APP ICONS:

You need 2 PNG icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

EASIEST WAY:
1. Go to: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload your logo/image
3. Select "Generate icons for Android"
4. Download the 192x192 and 512x512 PNG files
5. Rename them to icon-192.png and icon-512.png
6. Place them in: public/images/

OR use this free tool:

TEMPORARY FIX:
For now, I'll update manifest.json to not require icons.
This will let you build the APK, but you should add proper icons later!
